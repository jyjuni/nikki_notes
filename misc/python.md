# Python



## Generators

> Generators allow you to iterate over a collection, one item at a time without ever having to represent the entire data set in a data structure (such as a list)

- 生成: 

  - `yield` in a loop

- 读取:

  ```python
  generator = f_generator(...)
  for sentence in generator:
    print(sentence)
  ```

- a form of *lazy evaluation*

## jupyter

**autoreload**

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```
