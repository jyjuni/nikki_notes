# Introduction

[lecture01_introduction.pdf](../slides/lecture01_introduction.pdf) 

**NLP:** Build systems that can understand and generate natural language. Focus on applications.

**Computational Linguistics:** Study human language using computational approaches.

## Applications in NLP

### **Information Retrieval**

### **Text Classification**

### **Sentiment Analysis**

### **Question Answering**

### **Summarization**

### **Machine Translation**

- challenges: word order, multiple translations for a word(need context), want to preserve meaning

- Until recently phrase-based translation was the predominant framework.
- Today neural network models are used.
- Google Translate supports > 100 languages. Near-human translation quality for some language pairs.

### **Virtual Assistants**

- Siri (Apple), Google Now, Cortana (Microsoft), Alexa (Amazon).

- Subtasks: Speech recognition, language understanding (in context?), speech generation, ...

### **Image Captioning**

- Neural Networks for Object Detection and  Language Generation.
- “Multi-modal” embeddings.
- dataset: Microsoft COCO data set

### **Visual Question Answering**

- Typically requires to understand **interactions / compositions** of multiple objects / activities in a scene.

## Evolution of ML techniques in NLP

- Rules and heuristics, patterns matching, formal grammars. 
- Statistical NLP, generative probabilistic models.
- Discriminative models, support vector machines, logistic regression.
- Back to large generative models.
- Neural networks, phase 1 (RNNs including LSTMs, CNNs)
- Neural networks, phase 2, transformer models, large language models, pretraining, few / zero-shot learning.

# Ambiguity 

## Levels of Linguistic Representation

**phonetics/phonology（语音/音系）:** sounds and sound patterns of language

**morphology（词法）**: formation of words

**syntax（句法）**: word order

**semantics（语义）**: word and sentence meaning

**pragmatics（语用）**: influence of context and situation



## Language Understanding / Generation as Translation

- Most NLP techniques can be understood as **translation tasks from one structure** (level of representation) **into another**.
- For each translation step:
  -  Construct search space of possible translations.
  - Find best paths through this space (decoding) according to some performance measure.

- Modern NLP relies on Machine Learning to figure out these translation steps.

### Syntactic Structure

**part-of-speech**: (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner, ...)

**constituents**:

**subjects and objects**:

**modification**:

### Structural Ambiguity

Interplay between constituent structure and modification.

#### Representing Modification

>  *[<u>Enraged cow</u>] [injures [<u>farmer [with axe]</u>]]*
>  NP 								 NP		 PP
>
>  vs:
>
>  *[<u>Enraged cow</u>] injures [<u>farmer</u>] [<u>with axe</u>]*
>  NP								 NP		 PP	

> *[Ban] on [nude dancing] [on governer's desk]*
>
> *[Ban] on [nude dancing [on governer's desk]]*

#### PP attachment

> *Enraged cow injures farmer with axe.*

#### noun-noun compounds

>  *Water fountain:* 	A fountain that supplies water.
>
> *Water ballet:* 	 	 A ballet that **takes place** in water.
>
> *Water meter:* 	  	A device that **measures** water.
>
> *Water barometer:*   A barometer that **uses** water (instead of mercury) to measure air pressure. 
>
> *Water glass:* 			A glass that is meant to **hold** water.

### Other tricky issues

#### Need for deep semantic knowledge

#### Language Variety

#### Domains and Language Change

- Non-standard English
- Idioms
- Neologisms

### Morphology

- Structure and formation of words.

- **Derivational** morphology: Create new words from old words (can also change the part-of-speech). 

  > anti- + dis- + **establish** + -ment + -arian + -ism

- **Inflectional** morphology:

  - Convey information about number, person, tense, aspect, mood, voice, and the role a word plays in the sentence (case).

  - English has few morphological categories, but many languages are morphologically rich.

    >  Morphological categories in English:
    > - Number (*“dog”, “dog +s”*)
    >
    > - Person (“*I run*”, “*She runs*”) 
    > - Tense (*“He wait+ed”*)
    > - Voice (“*The issue* **was** *decid+ed”)*
