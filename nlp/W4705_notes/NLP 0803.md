## Word Alignments

 [Ungraded Exercise: IBM Model 2](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/153361/assignments/875771?module_item_id=1820660) 

### IBM Model 2

**Simplifying assumption**:   alignments are one-to-many, i.e.  each *f* word originates from exactly one *e* word (not many-to-one, many-to-many, ...) 

### MT Evaluation

#### BLUE Metric

- **B**i**L**ingual **E**valuation **U**nderstudy

- Modified n-gram precision with length penalty. Recall is ignored.

- pros: Quick, inexpensive, and language independent; correlates highly with human eval

- cons:  

  - Bias against synonyms and inflectional variations. 

  - Penalizes variations in word-order between languages in different families.

# Semantic Roles

 [lecture17_semantic_roles.pdf](/Users/yijiajin/Desktop/W4705 NLP/slides/lecture17_semantic_roles.pdf) 

## Predicate-Argument Structures

### Valency / Syntactic Frames

### Diatheses Alternation

>  The ability of a verb to appear in **a pair of syntactic frames (**"alternation")
>
> *John*[subj] **broke** *the window**[dobj]* --> *the window**[subj]* **broke**

### Alternations and Verb Meaning

observations:

- Alternations preserve the meaning of the sentence

- The constituents change **grammatical function**, but continue to play the same **thematic role.**
- Verb's participating **in the same set of alternations** seem to be semantically similar, that is they have some **common semantic component.**

### Levin's Verb Classes

***(Levin 1993)***

Identify common semantic component.

### VerbNet

***(Kipper Schuler 2006)***

Classes contain:

- a subset of **thematic roles**.

- a **list of syntactic frames** (i.e. an alternation pattern), illustrating how thematic roles can be mapped to grammatical function.

- a **semantic representation (****semantic predicates****)** specifying how the thematic roles interact.

### Fillmore’s “Case for Case”

***(Fillmore 1968)***

- "deep cases" (later also known thematic roles or theta roles) are linguistic universals.

## Thematic Roles

- Difficult to come up with a specific inventory of roles that generalizes across all verbs.
- A widely agreed upon set:

Solutions: 
- fewer thematic roles (Dowty's proto-roles [Dowty 1991])   
- More thematic roles (Frame semantics [Fillmore 1986],
  - FrameNet: different role inventory   for each frame)

 

### Proto Roles

***(Dowty 1991)***

- Role types are not discrete categories, but "cluster concepts"  
- Proto-Agent
- Proto-Patient

#### Propbank

***(Palmer et al. 2005)***

##### Roles

Roles are simply numbered (Arg0, Arg1, ..., ArgM) .

Interpretation of roles is *verb-sense specific*, but as consistent as possible.  

Arg0: PROTO-AGENT 

Arg1: PROTO-PATIENT

##### ArgM

##### Frame sets

- Each verb-sense corresponds to a **frame-set**, which specifies:
  - a set of roles and their definition **(role-set,** ~theta grid)
  - a set of subcategorization frames

- All frame-sets for a verb form a **frames file**

Observations:

- Syntax and semantics do not map 1:1. Generalize away from syntactic variations.

- PropBank senses are coarse (for example, metaphorical uses treated the same as   literal senses). 

### Frame Semantics

idea: instead of fixed inventory of words, different words can evoke the *same* frame

- issues with thematic roles/deep cases(slide 27-28)

#### Frame Elements

Frames describe the interaction/relation between a set of frame-specific semantic roles called Frame Elements (FEs).

#### FrameNet
