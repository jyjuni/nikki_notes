### AMR Notation

notation is based on PENMAN:

- Vertices labeled with concepts
- Edges labeled with semantic roles

### Inverse Relation

**How do we know what is the root?**

- Identify the focus of the sentence ("main assertion")
- ARG1-of

### Constants

- Some vertices do not carry variables but constants.
- Examples: Proper names, quantities, negation, ...

### Passive Voice

In passive sentences the subject often plays the ARG1 role and the ARG0 (that is, usually the agent) is sometimes omitted. 

> We are expected to meet him at 4:00pm in the courtyard.<img src="NLP 0808.assets/Screen Shot 2022-08-10 at 11.26.05 AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-10 at 11.26.05 AM" style="zoom:40%;" />

A passive sentence could still specify the ARG0 like this:

> we are expected **by the teacher** to meet him at 4:00pm in the courtyard 



### Normalization

- generalize across parts of speech and etymologically related words

- **don't** generalize over synonyms.

Nominal Predicates

> “proposal”

> “teacher”
